!1 OCSlimProject Example Test Page
Below is a simple Decision Table based Acceptance Test. It sends input to an instance of a Fixture which is implemented in your Xcode project. This is done by adding a class of the same name e.g. 'FixtureExample.swift' to your Acceptance Test target.

The first column 'input' will set a property of the same name. The expected 'output?' denoted by columns with '?' at the end of the property name are returned by your Fixture and verified against the expected value in that column.

Click 'Test' to run this page and see this in action. After that check out ''!-FixtureExample.swift-!'' in your Xcode project to see the 'FixtureExample.swift' implementation.

!3 Logging

* Find log files for each test run in the current directory ./Logs/<DATE>.log. 
* Log statements are reported in the 'Execution Log' (see the button after running a test located in the top right navigation).
* Test runs that generate no log statements will not generate a log file.

!4 iOS:
* NSLog()
* os_log()
* print() does not work!
 
!4 macOS X:
